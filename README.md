# Art Gallery Database Description
The primary goal of the database is to facilitate the auction process and purchases for art enthusiasts. It  plays a crucial role in assisting our staff in managing art sales through auctions by offering a wealth of information about artists and their works.

The database is intended for use by the following group of users: Artists, who are looking to present their work at auction events. Art Enthusiasts, who participate in auctions to acquire new pieces for their collections. Auction Houses, which organize and conduct auctions for art pieces. 

The database includes detailed information on "Artist," "Art Piece," "Auction," "Purchase," and "Purchase Detail." Each "Artist" is associated with their artworks, which are then categorized as "Painting," "Sculpture," or "Photography," each with specific attributes like paints used or material.

The database is an organized system for the auction-based purchase and sale of art pieces. These artworks are included in "Auction" events, where "Art Enthusiasts" can engage with the available pieces. The final sale and price details are captured in the "Purchase" and "Purchase Detail" records, which log the financial exchange between the buyer and the seller after the auction concludes. This system is essential for the smooth operation of purchasing and selling art through auctions, ensuring that all information is meticulously documented and managed.
